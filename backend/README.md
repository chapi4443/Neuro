# Neurogen AI Backend

This is the backend for the Neuro application, which includes both a Node.js and a Flask component. The backend is responsible for handling various functionalities related to stroke risk prediction and providing medical advice. Below is a brief overview of the folder structure and the purpose of each file.

## Folder Structure

- `config`: Configuration files
- `controllers`: Controllers for handling different routes
- `db`: Database related files
- `errors`: Error handling utilities
- `middleware`: Custom middleware for the application
- `models`: Data models for the application
- `node_modules`: Node.js dependencies
- `routes`: Route definitions for the application
- `utils`: Utility functions and modules

### Files

- `app.js`: Main Node.js application file responsible for server setup and middleware configuration.
- `app.py`: Main Flask application file responsible for handling stroke risk prediction and medical advice generation.
- `healthcare-data...`: Healthcare data file (contents not provided).
- `logistic_re... M`: Model file for the logistic regression model (contents not provided).
- `uppackage-lock.json`: Node.js package lock file.
- `apw package.json`: Node.js package.json file.
- `README.md`: You are currently reading this file.
- `requirements.txt`: Python requirements file for the Flask application.
- `.env`: Environment variables configuration file.
- `.gitignore`: Git ignore file to specify files and directories to ignore in version control.

### App.js

The `app.js` file is the entry point for the Node.js application. It configures the server, sets up middleware, connects to the database, and defines various routes for the application. It also starts the server and listens on the specified port.

### App.py

The `app.py` file is the main Flask application responsible for predicting stroke risk and generating medical advice. It loads necessary libraries and models, preprocesses data, and defines endpoints for handling various requests related to stroke risk prediction and medical advice generation.

### Package.json

The `package.json` file includes the dependencies and scripts for managing the Node.js application. It provides scripts for starting the Node.js server and running both the Node.js and Flask applications concurrently.

### Requirements.txt

The `requirements.txt` file lists the Python dependencies required for the Flask application. It includes libraries and modules necessary for data preprocessing, model training, and generating medical advice.
